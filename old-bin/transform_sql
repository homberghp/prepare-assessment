# This is an example of a transform script.
# it's purpose to transform some files AFTER they have been copied to the temporary sandboxes, one per candidate,
# which are to be imported into the repository, before the actual svn import takes place.
# The script receives three parameters per invocation:
# 1. the rootpath which is the root of the files that need to be transformed. 
#    This root typically points into the temproary sandboxes mentioned above.
# 2. The pre-transfomation pattern, or the text that is to be substituted. 
#    Something like __STUDENT_ID__, something that is different form all other cwords in the text.
#     
# 3. The replacement text. This is the text that replaces the pre-transfomation text, like in 'Pieter van den Hombergh (879417)'
#    The quotes should be part of the expression.
#
# This example script transforms all .sql files it finds below the rootpath.
#  @author Pieter van den Hombergh. Some linux knowlegde hurts no one.
