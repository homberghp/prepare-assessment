This document describes how to use the script collection to prepare
and correct a SEBI Venlo performance assessment using USB sticks with
a live Linux image. This document and the scripts described are
maintained at github in the project
link:https://github.com/homberghp/prepare-assessment[homberghp/prepare-assessment]
and is covered by the *Artistic License 2.0*.

The current way of working (as of February 2016) involves a number of steps:

* Preparation
  . Preparing or updating the live image.
  . Installing the live image on the sticks: prepare sticks.
  . Preparing an exam, i.e. creating student repositories and initial checkout.
  . Inserting individual exams on the sticks for an exam session. Prime the sticks.
* taking/executing the exam.
  . Booting student laptops from the USB sticks.

* Post processing
  . harvest the exam work and commit the final student work.
  . move the student repositories to the correction server.
  . initialize the workbench or correct any other way.

Since the typical usage does _not_ always use _all_ steps, the arrangement in
this documentation is such that it has the most frequent steps first and the
less frequent steps later in this text. In particular,  the steps 1 and 2 in
preparation only have to be taken to create the initial image or when an update
of the image (e.g. new NetBeans or Java version) is required. The description
below is based on a set of scripts and favors convention over configuration. In
particular, a specific directory layout is part of the convention, and all
scripts are to be executed from or within the assessment relevant sub-directory
as the working directory, since the scripts will look for specifically named
files relative to the working directory.
