== Take the exam

During the exam you will hand out the sticks to the students, who will come in almost
random order. To be able to associate a stick with a student, you
should note *who* receives _which_ stick. One option is to pre-associate the sticks,
that is, assign each stick to a particular student before the exam is taken.
This however has the problem that you typically have to prepare more sticks then
are really needed, in particular when the students are allowed to take a exam
at will and do not have to register and be penalized when not appearing.

=== Register: Associate the sticks to the candidates.

During exam you must somehow register which student received which stick. This
association can be done quite efficiently by making sure each student has some
paper or ID with his *student-id* (fontys student number, 7 digits, available as
barcode on the student ID card). You could also use
https://peerweb.fontysvenlo.org/index.php[peerweb] table cards for that, which
are produced by clicking the appropriate link in the
https://peerweb.fontysvenlo.org/grouplist.php[peerweb grouplist view]. They have the required code on the bottom. Put them on the tables to assign the students to tables, and when the time is ready, have them
come to the invigilators desk with the id or table card, so you can scan that
with a barcode reader. Open a new spreadsheet, add the column names as below and
add the expected sequence of stick numbers in the first column.

Now the trick is to hand out the sticks in fixed numerical (or reversed) order and
scan that into a spreadsheet, in which the first column contains the sequence numbers
of the sticks you are going to use and next will be the student number.
Save it in a file `sticks.csv` and commit it to the build for the exam.
Format of the csv file:

.example csv file
[source,csv]
----
sticknr;snummer
100;2224053
101;2524392
102;2632683
----

Save the file as stcks.csv in csv format, dos or unix (not OS-X) line ending: cr-lf or just lf.

You should *add* and *commit* the sticks.csv file as part of the build directory.
