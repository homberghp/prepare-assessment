== Assessment preparation.

An Assessment is composed of one or more projects in as many
sub-directories. The assumptions is made that exam questions or
variants thereof can be reused. Such projects are placed under
the directory `questions`. In our practice the assessment related
resources are placed under `45_asssessment` like in the case of STA1:


[NOTE]
----
All the command and scripts  below assume that you have an up to date `teambin` as well as `/home/prepareassessment/bin` in your PATH. This should be configured in your `.bashrc` file or the equivalent on your OS. On osirix, this done autmagically in the `/etc/bash.bashrc.local` file which included on every bash startup.

For SEBI, this means that you should check out the relevant part of the
repository to a sandbox on the preparation workstation. For me (*hom* on my local machines)
 and *java1* that is:

[[checkout-for-java1]]
.checkout for java1
[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/sebi/java1/trunk/
$ cd ~/sebi/java1/trunk/
$ svn co svn+ssh://osirix/fontysvenlo.org/home/modules/java1/svnroot/trunk/45_assessment
----

Since many of the attributes or properties of the assessments for a
course are the same, the conventions say that the properties are either:

* In a file called `default.properties` in the builds
  directory. Typically this already is present when you check out as
  shown before. If not, create the file, make sure the content is
  correct and add and commit it to the module repository.
* Derived from the name of the subdirectory for the specific
  exam. Here the convention is to use the exam data in short ISO-8601
  format, YYYYMMDD as in 20160104 (4th of November 2016) for the date
  this text was created.
* In a file named `setup.properties`, per assessment date (sub directory).

`setup.properties` is read last, meaning that the definitions in that file take precedence over
those in `default.properties`.

Both property files have the syntax of Java property files, which can be
consumed as shell (bash) source files, or parsed by perl. Because shell (bash)
has the peculiarity of not accepting white space around the assignment operator (=),
write the config declarations avoiding unnecessary white space. If you need to
add you own properties, prefer names and values without white space, because
white space will cause more harm then good. However, text that should be used
verbatim for insertion into files will typically cause no problems.


[[default.properties]]
.default.properties (example for JAVA1, excerpt:)

finish_text=When ready, save all files, make a final commit, close the IDE and SHUTDOWN the computer BEFORE you unplug the stick.
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you commit the setup files to the repository too. While you are creating the sticks on one machine, the correction
takes place on another, so the information on what sticks are being used is relevant in all phases of pre- and prost-processing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In the current setup, the directory that is used on the preparation
server reflects the names and structure of the stick. This means that
the scripts use a global directory /home/exam and steps below will
*DELETE ANY PREVIOUS SETUP OF OTHER ASSESSMENTS*.

=== Preparing for one Assessment

[NOTE]
To make this all work, add the directory containing all scripts to
your PATH variable,
e.g. `PATH=$PATH:/home/prepareassessment/bin`. You may want to have that permanently, so add it to your .bash_profile of .bashrc script, and close and reopen the the terminal to refresh the environment.

Preparing for an assessment involves:

* Create an appropriately named sub-directory as in `20161103`.
* Inside said directory, copy and adapt the setup.properties file, in
  particular set the `is_netbeans_project` property correctly, and the start
  number and count of the sticks to use. This determines the identity
  of the sticks to be used and therefor repositories and sandboxes to
  be created.
* Add the exam questions and solutions. The convention is to put this
  information in a script file called *doexports* to be executed as
  normal user with `./doexports`. For JAVA assessment this typically
  involves creating a somewhat complete script, specific to one assessment.
  For *DBS* and *STA*
  assessments, the question information is in a file called
  _questions.txt_ and makes this script reusable. Note that the script
  does an svn checkout and does NOT use the local sandbox, to ensure
  that the exam questions as used in the exam are also versioned in
  the repository.
* Execute the ./doexports`, which should result in the folders *examsolution* and
  an *examproject* , the later being the sub-directory containing all the
  information to be placed on the stick and imported into the
  student/stick specific repositories. The script not only checks out the exam exercises
  to the examsolution directory, but can also strip out the solutions in the _copy-to-examproject_ step. This makes it possible to *only* have to maintain the complete R, SQL, or Java project, including the work exercises with known to be correct solutions. +
  *Before* you do the next steps,
  check that the examproject directory is complete on the one hand, and
  is exactly what you want published on the stick. You could use the
  tools that students use in the assessment (netbeans, r-studio or
  pgadmin, simple editor) to verify that.

* Create the repositories. For that we have a script called
  `makerepos.pl` which uses the information described previously. The
  script does not directly create the repositories, but rather outputs
  script text that will. This script is a bash source text, which is conventionally
  redirected to _doit.sh_. Rationale is that the shell text is
  potentially destructive, and must be executed with elevated (sudo)
  rights.
 . Do `makerepos.pl > doit.sh`
 . The script does some last validation checks on the examproject,
  such as how many questions are involved and that the question id tags
  are unique. This information is output via stderr, so that you will see it
  even if you redirect the normal output to doit.sh as in the above example.
 . Then do `sudo bash doit.sh` and have a little patience, as doit.sh
 will create *a repository per stick*, imports the examproject in each of
 them and then will checkout said repository in a sandbox per
 candidate on the "Desktop" of each stick. This can take a few
 thousand milliseconds.
 . Create a sym-link in the assessment directory called *skel.tgz* which
 should point to a tar.gz file, which in turn should contain the
 initial content of the candidate home directory (/home/exam), such
 that personal preferences (NetBeans), links in browsers (e.g. javadoc,
 postgressql manual) and desktop (xfce) configuration are set up. This
 skeleton does NOT contain anything assessment specific.
 Typically the skeleton tar file is stored under _/home/prepareassessment/data_ and will have a name revealing its creation date. Typically, using the latest is just fine.

[[example-skel-link]]
.example skelleton link
[source,shell]
----
ln -sf /home/prepareassessment/data/skel20161018.tgz skel.tgz
----

You are now set up to create the sticks.

=== Stick filling.

The final step before the exam is putting the stick specific content on the sticks.
This will also add a stamp to the Desktop directory on the stick.
Stamping the desktop in this way make the desktop recognisable as
being an exam environment for this particular exam, and identifies
the stick at the same time. Note that the examproject and the prompt in the terminal also will identify the stick. The sticky label on the stick is typically on the bottom when inserted in  the computer's USB port, alas.

This step should be executed in the assessment builds sub-directory such as `…​/builds/20161103.`

The script to execute is `primeSticks` , which takes no arguments and
must be executed with elevated privileges, because it copies files and
changes ownership to the exam user (on the stick as well as on the
preparation workstation).

Easiest is to walk to the directory if you are not already there, then
sudo -s, to elevate the rights. Then insert, *calmly*, the sticks into
the USB-hubs. Each hub supports 7 sticks and you can prime the sticks
in batches of 21 max on our priming workstation *sticky*.
After all sticks are inserted and all leds on
the hubs are lit, enter the primeSticks command and wait until the
(red) prompt returns.

We need to stress *insert calmly* because the OS on the preparation
workstation needs some time to detect and recognize the stick and
its ID. You can verify that the stick is properly recognized by the blue light being lit and a stick icon per stick on the desktop (if you are using ubuntu unity as we do). Hovering over the stick icon will reveal its name.

The number-order in which you insert the sticks is irrelevant, because
the stick preparation adds an identification to the sticks that can be
used to match a stick to an exam and the label on the stick.

[WARNING]
Take care that you insert only sticks that are within the range you
declared in setup.properties., because only those will have a repo and
sandbox prepared.

[[Example-run]]
.Example primeSticks run
[source,shell]
----
.../20161018 $ sudo -s
# # insert sticks
# primeSticks
.... output ....
# # do this as often as you have batches of say 21 to have primed all sticks.
# exit
$

There is also a youtube demo: image:images/youtube.png[alt="youtube", title="prime sticks demo" ,link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xv3IHg51xk"]

It proved to be practical to use a random sample stick from the ones
of the first batch to boot a test laptop, to see if indeed all that
is needed, and no more, is on the sample stick. If not, revisit the
previous steps. If it is okay, continue for the remaining batches.

[TIP]
To be on the safe side, and because of the warning before, make a
(tar) backup of both the repositories under /home/exam named
EXAMxyz-repo and all sandboxes under
/home/exam/Desktop/examproject-EXAMxyz. Convention: name the tar files
after the exam, e.g. JAVA120161103-repo.tgz and
JAVA120161103-sandboxes.tgz

Once you have primed all sticks, you are ready to rock/exam.
